# UKUIHelper
UI Helper library for Ultrakill mods. This mod doesn't do anything on its own, its is meant as a dependency for other mods.

# Installation
This is a BepInEx mod. To install, just unzip the downloaded file inside  BepInEx/plugin folder (or UKMM Mods if using UKMM)

Note: I have no idea if this can work on other games but i doubt it.

# Building
If you decide to build this mod, make sure to copy the "Sprites" folder and the UKUIHelper.dll (no other file that got generated) file inside a single folder when it finishes building. Both need to be in the same folder to work.
